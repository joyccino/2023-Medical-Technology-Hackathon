We are excited to announce that our team clinched the top spot at the MEDIVATE Healthcare Hackathon 2023 with our project designed to promote physical activity among senior citizens.

# Project Overview

"NeuroDance" 🕺💃 is a testament to the remarkable potential of technology in enhancing lives. Recognizing the importance of keeping our elderly population active and engaged, we embarked on a mission to make a tangible impact.

# Eldercise - Empowering Through Movement

Our program leverages state-of-the-art technology, including HTML, Javascript, CSS, Pouch DB, and Mediapipe (a machine learning-based hand-tracking library), to create personalized exercise routines tailored for seniors. With user-friendly interfaces and AI-driven guidance, we're simplifying the path to an active and healthy lifestyle for our elderly loved ones. 🏋️‍♀️

# A Global Health Initiative

We are committed to further developing and expanding NeuroDance to reach senior citizens worldwide. Together, we can contribute to an improved quality of life for our aging population. 🌍

# Acknowledgments

This achievement wouldn't have been possible without the unwavering dedication of our exceptional team members: Joy Soobeen Moon, Ruize Geng, Tanisha Ahuja and Alice Yoonjung Woo. Each member brought unique skills and a shared passion for creating a brighter future for our seniors. 🙌
